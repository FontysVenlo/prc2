== Logging

Logging can be a very powerful instrument to squeeze very much or very precise information from a running application. It can be configured without modifying the source code. Use logging instead of system.out.print

.Using a supplier suppresses the generation of the log when the log level is not active.
[source,java]
----
public static void main( String[] args ) {
    Logger logger = Logger.getLogger( Main.class.getName() ); // <1>
    logger.log( Level.FINE,                                   // <2>
       ()-> String.format("Hello %1$s args length= %2$d ",    //<3>
                          "world", args.length)               //<4>
    );
}
----

<1> Create a specific logger for this class.
<2> This log statement only does 'work' when the log level is set to FINE or higher (FINER, FINEST)
<3> Note the use of positional parameters in the format string. It can be quite useful. See it as a free and random tip.
<4> This lambda has the shape of a supplier and is only evaluated or computed when the logging level is active.

=== Replace `soutv`` by using a log macro

When you use a supplier to supply the message that is logged, when logging is active, logging can become cheap.
To make this work, you might want to teach your IDE to help a bit here, by adding a keyboard macro that adds
logging instead of simple System.out.println(...).

.`logv` definition for NetBeans IDE
[source,java]
----
logger.fine( ()->"${EXP instanceof="<any>" default="exp"} = " + ${EXP});
----

Now logging becomes simpler than ever.

. First create a logger with the already define macro [black]`logr` [tab] and then
. inside the methods use [black]`logv` [tab] instead of [black] `soutv` wherever you would like to output stuff for debugging.

In your logging.properties file add the proper level for your class or as global and you can turn the logging on or off whenever you need to.

=== Configure logging

When you copy the file logging.properties from its default location [green]`$JAVA_HOME/conf/logging.properties` to your projects
directory, preferably under a `conf` directory, you can modify and adapt that file to make logging effective in a very precise way,
by specifying what level you want for what class.

.conf/logging.properties file excerpt. Set logging to fine for one program.
[source,properties]
----
#.properties
handlers= java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler
.level=FINE #<1>
java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level=FINE
logdem.LogDem.level=FINE #<2>
----

<1> specify global level
<2> specify for one class
Then in the java startup (for instance in a run script or in one of the IDE settings), make sure this java property specifies the file.

For NetBeans add [blue]`-Djava.util.logging.config.file=conf/logging.properties` to the java run actions.

Say the class that needs debugging is called `logging.Main`.  Then in the logging properties file (see above) add
 `logging.Main.level = FINE`, and make sure that you start the JVM with the proper login properties file.

[TIP]
====
You can also set the parameter in the 'run-configuration' of your project.
Add the appropriate option there, e.g. -Djava.util.logging.config.file=conf/logging.properties

.point to project specific log file.
