== Parameterized tests

[big]#You will often see that test methods look a lot like each other. As an example:
In the fraction exercise, in most test methods you have two inputs and one or two results,
then an operation is done followed by some assertion, often of the same kind.
This quickly leads to the habit of _copy and waste_ programming. Many errors are introduced this way: You copy the original,
tweak the copy a bit and you are done. Then you forget one required tweak, because they are easy to miss, but you do not notice it until too late.#

[WARNING]

Avoid [big]_copy and waste_ at almost all times. It is [big red]*NOT* a good programming style. If you see it in your code, refactor it to
remove the copies, but instead make calls to one version of it. This will make you have _less_ code overall. Coding excellence is never measured
in number of code lines, but in quality of the code. Think of gems. They are precious because they are rare.

The _copy and waste_ problem can even become worse: When the original has a flaw, you are just multiplying the
number of flaws in your code. This observation applies to test code just as well. +

*CODE THAT ISN'T WRITTEN CAN'T BE WRONG*.

=== Parameterized test, Junit 5 style

Below you see an example on how you can condense the `toString()` tests of fraction from 5 very similar test methods into 5 strings containing the test data
and 1 (say one) test method. +
Paraphrasing a saying: [green big]_Killing many bugs with one test_.

.Complete fraction test class with parameterized test, using an in-code csv source
[source,java]
----
package fraction;

import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;
import org.junit.jupiter.params.ParameterizedTest;
import org.junit.jupiter.params.aggregator.ArgumentsAccessor;
import org.junit.jupiter.params.provider.CsvSource;

public class FractionCSVSourceTest {

    @ParameterizedTest
    @CsvSource( {
           //"message,          expected,     n,   d", //<1>
           "'two thirds',        '(2/3)',     2,   3", //<2>
           "'whole number,           '2',     2,   1",
           "'one third',         '(1/3)',    -3,  -9",
           "'minus two fifths',  '(-2/5)',   12, -30",
           "'one + two fifths', '(-1-(2/5))',   35, -25"
    } )
    void fractionOps( String message, String expectedString,
            int numerator, int denominator ) { // <3>

        Fraction f = new Fraction( numerator, denominator );
        assertThat( f.toString() )
                .as( message )
                .isEqualTo( expectedString );
    }
}

<1> Adding a comment is always a good idea. You may also want your values aligned for improved readability.
<2> Parameters are separated by commas, which maybe in the test values. In that case you can demarcate Strings with single quotes inside the csv record string.
  If you need another separator instead of comma, you can specify that too,
  see https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org.junit.jupiter.params/org/junit/jupiter/params/provider/CsvSource.html[CsvSource API ^].
<3> The parameters are passed in as the type(s) provided by the test method's signature. The Junit-5 framework will (try to) parse the csv record elements accordingly.

For more details see https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-parameterized-tests[Junit 5 parameterized tests ^].

The CsvSource version of parameterized test is the simplest to use and easily understood.
 It keeps data and the test together, nicely near to each other, so it make it easy to read the
 tests and data in one glance.
 They typically fit easily on a screen. Remember the importance of readability of code. That too applies to test code.

=== Lookup in a map.

Sometimes there is no easy way to get from a string to some object, or even class.
Examples are that you want to test for the correct *type* or *exception*, or supply a method name, but you cannot put that into a string without doing complex
things like reflection which we may only do in later parts of the course. The trick is to use a `Map` that maps a string to the object of choice.

The lookup trick might also be applicable when you want to have short values in your test data table, like a message number which is mapped
to the actual longer expected message, or even a message that is a format string and can be used in `Assertion.as( formatString, Object... args)`.

.map from short string to test (Person) object.
[source,java]
----
 static Map<String, Person> emap = Map.of(
            "piet", new Person("Piet", "Puk", LocalDate.of(1955-03-18),"M"),
            "piet2", new Person("Piet", "Puk", LocalDate.of(1955-03-18),"M"), // for equals test.
            "rembrandt", new Person("Rembrandt", "van Rijn", LocalDate.of(1606,7,15),"M"),
            "saskia", new Person("Saskia", "van Uylenburgh", LocalDate.of(1612,8,11),"F"),
    );
----

It is particularly applicable to lambda expressions.
You can translate a string into a lambda, by using a map. You can then use simple names (strings),
that can be put in a csv record. 

.Map of string to lambda
[source,java]
----
    final Map<String, BiFunction<Fraction, Fraction, Fraction>> ops = // <1>
      Map.of(
              "times", ( f1, f2 ) -> f1.times( f2 ),
              "plus", ( f1, f2 ) -> f1.plus( f2 ),
              "flip", ( f1, f2 ) -> f1.flip(), // <2>
              "minus", ( f1, f2 ) -> f1.minus( f2 ),
              "divideBy", ( f1, f2 ) -> f1.divideBy( f2 )
      );
----

<1> Note that we use a https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/function/BiFunction.html[BiFunction<T,U,R>] existing functional interface,
with *T*, *U*, and *R* all of the same type: Fraction. This is legal.
<2> f2 is not used in the right hand side of the arrow. This is legal too.

.Using lambda names in test data
[source,java]
----
    @ParameterizedTest
    @CsvSource(
             {
                "'one half times one third is 1 sixth', 'times', '(1/6)',1,2,1,3", // <1>
                "'one thirds plus two thirds is 1'    , 'plus',      '1',1,3,2,3",
                "'flip'                               , 'flip',      '3',1,3,1,3", // <2>
                "'one half minus two thirds is'       , 'minus', '(-1/6)',1,2,2,3"
            } )
----

<1> The operation name is the second value in the csv record, here *times*. Note that you can quote strings, but that is not required.
<2> In the flip operation, the second fraction is ignored, so any legal value is allowed. Here we use the same values for both fractions.

.Test method using the test data (Annotations left out, they are above).
[source,java]
----
    void fractionOps( String message, String opName, String expected,
                  int a,int b, int c, int d ) { // <1>
        // Arrange: read test values
        Fraction f1 = frac( a, b ); // <2>
        Fraction f2 = frac( c, d );
        BiFunction<Fraction, Fraction, Fraction> op = ops.get( opName ); // <3>

        // Act
        Fraction result = op.apply( f1, f2 ); // <4>

        // Assert(That) left out as exercise.
        // Use assertThat on the fraction object result
        //   and check if it has the correct string value.
        // Use the message in the as(...) method.

    }
----

<1> The fraction parameters a,b,c, and d are captured from the csvrecord. This makes the parameter list a +
  tad longer, but also more understandable. JUnit 5 csvsource uses the annotation and the signature of the test method and can deal
  with most common types such as primitive, String and LocalDate (preferably in ISO-8601 format such as '2012-01-14' for the day of writing this). Strings in the csv-records will be automatically converted to the parameter types in your test methods in these cases.
<2> The fraction instances are created from a, b, c, and d.
<3> The operation (op) is looked up in the map.
<4> Apply the operation, or rather the function and capture the result.

You can apply the same trick of looking up with enums too, even easier, because the enum itself can translate from String to value,
as long as the spelling is exact.

Study the examples above, they might give you inspiration with the exercises coming up and will score you points during the exam.

[TIP]
====
As of the moment of writing (Januari 2021, Junit 5.7), the parameterized test [red]*can't* deal with varargs parameters, that is a varying
list of parameters, with the triple dot notation.
====

=== Test data from a file

Sometimes the amount of data you have in your test data-set is so big that it does not comfortably fit inside a `@CsvSoure` annotation.
You specify an external file as data source with to achieve the same, the annotation now is `@CsvFileSource`, which takes files as argument.

The file, as you might have guessed, can be a csv file, which can be edited quite comfortably with a https://plugins.netbeans.apache.org/catalogue/?id=1[NetBeans plugin]
or with the help of a spreadsheet program like Libreoffice calc or Microsoft excel.

Suppose you need to develop an input validator that has many test cases. Putting the inputs in a file along with other information relevant
to your validator.

.csvfile source
[source,java]
----
  @ParameterizedTest
  @CsvFileSource( resources = { "testdata.csv" } )
  void testRegex( String message, String input, boolean matches, int groupCount ){
    // your code here
  }
----


// TODO regex stuff, added named group. See stackoverflow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27498106/regular-expression-named-capturing-groups-support-in-java-7/27498107

[NOTE]
====
At the time of writing JUnit wants the csv file for CsvFileSource to be +
in the `{project-directory}src/test/resources` folder or a child folder thereof.
To be able to do that, you *first* need to create that folder.
====

// TODO string with | as varargs...

=== Repeated use of same data.

In some cases, multiple tests need the same data. In the case of a CsvSourceFile, that is easily covered: Simple copy the annotations to all places where you need
them. This is an _acceptable form_ of copy and waste, because the annotations all point to one source of truth, the CSV file.

Sometimes you would like to keep or even generate the test data inside the test class.
Do not take the simple and naive route to simply copy-and-waste the (largish) cvssource data,
but instead stick to the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself[D.R.Y. rule].

One problem is that a method in Java can return only one result, either object or primitive type. Luckily
an array is also an object in Java.

There are two solutions to this issue.

. Create special test data objects of a special test data class, either inside your or outside your test class
  easy to make a test data class to carry the test data. In this case make a data providing method and use the method name in the `@MethodSource` annotation.
  The test method should understand the test data object.
. Use the JUnit5 provided `ArgumentsProvider`. This wraps an array of objects into one object, so that all can be returned as one (array) value in a stream. +
  This saves the implementation of a (simple) test data class.

Have a look at the https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/[JUnit5 documentation] to find a further explanation and examples.
