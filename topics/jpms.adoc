== Java Platform Module System

The Java Platform Module System has been introduced with Java 9 and had a long development history at
the point of introduction. For the Java developers at Oracle and others involved in the OpenJDK project it
was considered a necessary step to make Java fit for the future and make it possible to shed some old
nasty problems. In the development of Java there have been only a few *major* release, although each release of
Java introduces new features that are supposed to play nice with what is already available. This is called forward
and backward compatibility, so old programs keep working but can be maintained by using new features.

The important major releases were:

* Java 1. Duh.
* Java 1.2 introducing the collection framework.
* Java 5 introduces Generics and the first version of the concurrency framework. It also changed the naming scheme. Internally it still is Java 1.5.
* Java 8 introduced a functional style of programming using Functional interfaces and lambda expressions
* Java 9 introduced the Java Platform Module System, and the project under which it came into being was called *JigSaw*. +
  That last name points to the idea of taking the JDK and run-time library apart and recompose it using a better partitioning,
 actually applying separation of concerns in a big way. The project has been a multi year undertaking.

The changes provide the following advantages for the Java platform developers (from https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw[project jigsaw])

* Make it easier for developers to construct and maintain libraries and large applications;
* Improve the security and maintainability of Java SE Platform Implementations in general, and the JDK in particular;
* Enable improved application performance; and
* Enable the Java SE Platform, and the JDK, to scale down for use in small computing devices and dense cloud deployments.

As always with Java, the intent is that the new Java release (9) should be able to work very much the same as the earlier versions, and it does, without
problems. If you use the JVM and JDK in [blue]*classpath* mode, it works very much like older versions. You define the jar files you need for you app and off you go.

Although the intent always has been to make the transition as smooth as possible, when you want to use the module system to the fullest,
it has some consequences.

* Not everything in the JDK can be used in the same way as before, more protection is taking place as are checks.
* A module is *closed* by default and must explicitly export [blue]##package##s, if they are needed from outside the module.
* The classes in a module can't be reflected on by default. If that is needed, the package must be made [blue]##open##ed for reflection.
* At the moment of writing these restrictions can be modified with startup flags of the JVM. Later Java releases may change the default settings,
from rather permissive in Java 9 to more restricted in later releases. As an example, some settings became more strict with
Java 16 and https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/396[JEP 396 Strongly Encapsulate JDK Internals by Default].

Having a modular project or a non-modular project depends on the presence of a small file with a well defined name in a specific place.

The module-info.java file should reside in the root folder of the java sources (which makes the defaul package). The name of the file
is not a valid java type name and that is on purpose. The resulting class file contains the module declarations
which specifies what a module *needs* (_reads_ in JPMS terms) and what it provides (exports).

The keywords specific to the module declaration are

* [blue]#exports# What the module provides. Use with one package per line.
* [blue]#module# starts the declaration
* [blue]#open# if before the module, opens the whole module for reflection.
  For instance for a module that defines all entities of a multi-module application.
* [blue]#opens# allows reflection of a package. Use with one per package per line.
* [blue]#provides# To indicate that a module implements some interface with one or more implementations.
* [blue]#requires# Indicates what the module itself needs or *reads*. One package per line.
* [blue]#transitive# Used with requires to indicate that there is a requirement that is then made readable to the users of this module as well.
* [blue]#to# Used to restrict either exports or opens to specific other module(s).
* [blue]#uses# To indicate that a module uses a service [blue]##provide##d by another module.
* [blue]#with# Used with provides to indicate which implementation(s) are available for the
  provided interface implementation. See the https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/ServiceLoader.html[Service Loader API].

As a rule, the module [blue]#java.base# is 'required' by default, the same a [blue]#java.lang# is available or imported by default, considering packages to import.

Some examples of module-info.java files from the PRJ2-AIS-demo-project:


.Assembler
[source,java]
----
module assembler_module{
    requires persistence_module;
    requires datarecords_module;
    requires businesslogic_module;
    requires gui_module;
}
----

.DataRecords
[source,java]
----
module datarecords_module {
    exports datarecords;
}
----

.Persistence
[source,java]
----
module persistence_module {
    requires datarecords_module;
    exports persistence;
}
----

.BusinessLogic
[source,java]
----
module businesslogic_module {
    requires transitive datarecords_module;
    requires transitive persistence_module;

    exports businesslogic;
}
----

.GUI
[source,java]
----
module gui_module {
    requires javafx.controls;
    requires javafx.fxml;
    requires java.logging;
    requires java.base;
    requires businesslogic_module;

    opens gui to javafx.fxml;

    exports gui;
}
----

And another example from our ALDA course in which a Service is provided:

.ALDA sorting services
[source,java]
----
module sortingserviceapi {
    exports sortingservice; // <1>
}
// and
open module asortingservice {
    requires java.logging;
    requires sortingserviceapi;
    uses sortingservice.SortingServiceFactory; // <2>
    provides sortingservice.SortingServiceFactory
         with asortingservice.SortingServices; // <3>
}
----

<1> defines sortingservice.SortingServiceFactory in package sortingservice; this is an interface.
<2> uses and
<3> provides an implementation of the SortingServiceFactory interface with a specific implementation: SortingServices.

[WARNING,BIG]
====
JPMS explicitly forbids:

* Split packages, that is using the same package name in different modules with different content.
* Cyclic dependencies as in A requires B requires A.
====

The dependencies are validated at the startup of the JVM, when you start Java.
If any of the requirements is not met, the JVM refuses to start. This has the benefit
that it is immediately obvious what is missing, instead of having a runtime error, when a class can't be found, because
the module has not been specified in the path, as is the case with the classpath mode.

The split package has been a bit of an issue for testing, because in a modern project, (business) source and tests are separated into
separate source trees, often with the same package structure, which looks a bit like split packages. The build tools (e.g. maven) understand
this and can organise the files such that the JVM accepts it anyway.

=== Changes in visibility

Java has always had the visibility modifiers [blue]#public#, [blue]#protected#, [blue]#default#, and [blue]#private#, in descending order of access.
This is still effective with the same rules _within_ a module. However the module boundaries add an extra line of visibility defense.
A public element from module A is only visible to elements in module B if the public elements is part of an exported package.
As far as reflection goes. An element in module A is accessible via reflection only if the package of the element is open (with the [blue]#opens# keyword)
either globally or explicitly to module B ( e.g. `module A { exports aPackage to B;}`).


== Java Modules and Testing

.Encapsulation gone wrong: So much for shining security armor.
image:shiningArmor-cropped.png[role="thumb left", 400, title="So much for shining security armor", "Run Ivanhoe"] Project Jigsaw,
now known as the **J**ava **P**latform **M**odule **S**ystem solves problems
that lingered in the Java ecosystem since its inception. The standard encapsulation or visibility model
with protection or visibility modes `private`, `package private (default)` provide too
little defense against (ab)use of non-public API's. That plus the fact that reflection is very powerful.
A java security manager can put up some defense against reflection abuse, but enabling this kind of security is optional.footnote:[It was enforced in the now deprecated web applets]
This made many internal details of the JDK free game. Much like a knight in shiny armor is defenseless against a can opener.

[TIP]
====
The java platform module system (JPMS) promotes loose coupling.
====

This is all fine and good, but testing, in particular Unit testing relies on access to the 'private' parts
of a class and package, in particular the package private parts.

[TIP]
====
API or **A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface is defined as the publicly visible
parts of classes. In Java those are *public* and *protected* members (methods and fields).
Members that are neither public or protected should not be considered part of the API.

Actually, API in this case should be spelled APPI for **A**pplication **P**ublic **P**rogramming **I**nterface, but we all know
bad habits die slowly.

A smaller API has also a smaller attack surface for real security intrusions. This is another major reason for improved encapsulation of the
stuff in the JDK.

To minimize coupling, it is also wise to keep the API minimal, but without impairing the usefulness of the
API. Often an API can be enhanced with some convenience features that combine parts in the already public part. This does NOT enlarge exposed parts.
See for instance the methods in
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/Files.html[java.nio.file.Files].
====

=== Black box vs White Box

In testing, one distinguishes between so called *black* box and *white* box tests.

*Black box* in this respect means that you cannot see the internals, but only those parts defined in the API.
This is the way that a client package will use the API. Black box testing is easily supported by the module system, because the test classes behave as ordinary
clients. +
*White box* would better be called transparent box, but the name _white box_ stuck. In white box tests you *DO* want access to the (package) private parts
of your business code. This is a bit handicapped by the way the JPMS allows access.

=== Standard Source code organization.


//image::sourcetree-modular.png[title='default source tree ']

.source tree of genericdao
[source]
----
src
├── main
│   └── java
│       └── genericdao
│           ├── dao
│           ├── memory
│           └── pgdao
└── test
    └── java
        ├── genericdao
            ├── dao
            ├── memory
            └── pgdao

----

We are using maven, in which the unit test plugin is called *surefire*, the integration test plugin (which we
  did not use up to this point yet) is called *failsafe*.

The standard way source code is organized is by means of separate directories for
the 'business' code and the test code in two separate directory trees inside the same project. +
This practice, which prevents test code to land in the final application or library jar file is useful, so we will keep it as it is.

However, JPMS does not allow so called _split packages_. Surefire addresses this problem by telling
the JVM to _patch_ the module we are testing with the classes defined in the test source tree.
It is as if the test classes are put in the business source tree. +
This allows the test classes access to the package private parts of the classes, the way it worked in before JPMS.

.Module definition of sebi dao.
[soure,java]
----
module nl.fontys.sebidao {
    exports nl.fontys.sebivenlo.dao;
    exports nl.fontys.sebivenlo.dao.memory;
    exports nl.fontys.sebivenlo.dao.pg;
    requires java.logging;
    requires java.naming;
    requires java.sql;
    requires org.postgresql.jdbc;
}
----

// .The dependency graph of sebidao
// image::sebidao-summary.svg[]

The module definition above exports three packages and declares itself
dependent on 3 modules from Java API and one postgresql module.

Unit tests, and in particular the testing libraries such as AssertJ, and Mockito
use reflection to do their work. The simplest example is JUnit itself, which uses reflection to read the annotations
in the class file. So does Mockito. AssertJ uses reflection to get to fields (for deepEquals) and methods. Reflection is a tool very sharp indeed, to
get to the guts of the **S**ystem **U**nder **T**est. Of these Test libraries JUnit and AssertJ have module definitions already. Mockito and postgresql do not have that
at the time of writing this document (April 2020).

The quickest way to allow the testing tools access is to fully OPEN the packages of the *SUT* to world.
Because this happens during testing, surefire is instructed to tell the jvm (java), that runs the test, to
open those packages to the world. The snippet from the maven pom file that realizes that is given below. You can copy
and adapt it for your own purposes.

.sebipom project with surefire.opens property to open op required packages for testing. Requires sebipom >= 3.0.2
[source,xml]
----
<properties>
  <surefire.opens> <!--1-->
    --add-opens nl.fontys.sebivenlo.genericdao/genericdao.dao=ALL-UNNAMED <!--2-->
    --add-opens nl.fontys.sebivenlo.genericdao/genericdao.memory=ALL-UNNAMED
    --add-opens nl.fontys.sebivenlo.genericdao/genericdao.pgdao=ALL-UNNAMED
    --add-opens nl.fontys.sebivenlo.genericdao/usertypes=ALL-UNNAMED
    --add-opens nl.fontys.sebivenlo.genericdao/entities=ALL-UNNAMED,genericmapper
  </surefire.opens>
  <!--3-->
</properties>
----

<1> We are adding a property for the surefire plugin which is picked up by sebipom.
<2> In particular the arguments that are passed to the JVM that runs the tests,
  which appends *--add-opens* commands for all packages that require unit tests.
<3> Other properties are left out for brevity.

Of particular importance, and project specific are the [blue]`--add-opens` commands, which you must adapt to your own project's
pom file with your own module and package names.

.opens sets module and package
image::opens.svg[width=600]


*Opens* is the most powerful way of exporting a package. It allows full access (as in `exports`) plus reflection.
We could try to make more specific export lines such as *--add-export*, but although more precise, that will not help very much, because the
access enabling lines will only take effect during the (surefire) unit tests. +
If you have _failsafe_ integration tests, you will have to do
the same for the _failsafe_ plugin, although failsafe tests should stick to black box testing, where such can opener style configuration should not be required.
