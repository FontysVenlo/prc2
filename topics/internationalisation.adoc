== Internationalisation (I18N)

=== The Date and Time API

In Java, an `Instant` represents a point on the time line. The origin (called epoch) is arbitrarily set at midnight
of the first of January 1970 Greenwich time (UTC). `Instant.now()` returns the current point on the time line,
being the number of seconds since the epoch (stored as `long`) and the number of nano seconds (stored as `int`). Each
day has 24x60x60 = 86400 seconds. A `Duration` is the amount of time between two instants. Both `Instant` and `Duration`
are immutable.

An `Instant` does not have a human readable format. The two kinds of human time in the java API are _local date/time_ and
_zoned time_. Local date/time has a date and/or time of day, but no associated time zone. Examples:

image:calendar_example_LocalDate.png[width=25%, title="Local Date example"] Local Date example.
image:alarmclock.png[width=25%, title="Local Time example"] Local Time Example.

Do not use zoned time, unless really necessary. Today's date can be retrieved using `LocalDate.now()`, an arbitrary date
with `LocalDate.of(<year>, <month>, <day>)` like `LocalDate.of(2021, 5, 1)` being first of May 2021. The amount of time
between dates is called a `Period`. Check the java API to read about convenient methods of `LocalDate` and `Period`. An
interesting one is the `datesUntil(...)` method on `LocalDate`, which returns a `Stream<LocalDate>`.

`LocalTime` objects can be created like LocalDates, e.g.: `LocalTime endOfLecture = LocalTime.now().plusHours(1);`

Zoned times make use of time zomes. Java uses the IANA database: https://www.iana.org/time-zones
To make a zoned time out of a `LocalDateTime` you can use the `ZonedDateTime.of()` method or do it like this:
`ZonedDateTime current = LocalDateTime.now().atZone(ZoneId.of("Europe/Amsterdam"));`. Now you get a specific `Instant` in time.
The other way around, you can can find the corresponding `ZonedDateTime` in another time zone using `instant.atZone(...)`.

To represent dates and times in readable and customizable formats, use the `DateTimeFormatter` class. It can use predefined
standard formatters, `Locale` specific formatters and formatters with custom patterns.

This paragraph is based on Core Java Volume 2, 11th edition, chapter 6 by Cay Horstmann.


=== Number Formats

Some of you might have noticed that one of the teacher tests in the FXTriangulate exercise fails on your machine.

This is because on the machine we developed, the locale is set to en_US.
This causes the numbers to be formatted in the way that [blue]`Double.parseDouble(String input)` expects it.
If you run the same tests on a machine with say a German Locale, the test that reads the length back from the label,
use Double.parseDouble(), which is then surprised to find a comma instead of the decimal point, and fails with a format exception.

To solve that, modify the test in method [blue]#tLength# such that the line +
`double l = Double.parseDouble( ltext.split( ":" )[ 1 ] );` reads +
`double l = getDoubleConsideringLocale( ltext.split( ":" )[ 1 ] );`,
so that the whole test method reads

.fxtriangulate.GUITest.tLength
[source,java]
----
@ParameterizedTest
@CsvSource( {
    "a,greenCircle,blueCircle,500.0,400.0,100.0,100.0,500.0",
    "b,redCircle,blueCircle,400.0,100.0,100.0,100.0,500.0",
    "c,greenCircle,redCircle,300.0,100.0,100.0,400.0,100.0", } )
public void tLength( String line, String p1, String p2, double expected,
        double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2 ) throws ParseException {
    double xOrg = stage.getX();
    double yOrg = stage.getY();
    FxRobot rob = new FxRobot();
    rob.drag( '#' + p1 ).dropTo( xOrg + x1, yOrg + y1 );
    rob.drag( '#' + p2 ).dropTo( xOrg + x2, yOrg + y2 );
    String ltext = labelMap.get( line ).apply( triangulator ).getText();
    double l = getDoubleConsideringLocale( ltext.split( ":" )[ 1 ] ); // <1>
    assertThat( l ).isCloseTo( expected, within( 0.1 ) );
//        fail( "method tLength reached end. You know what to do." );
}
----

<1> changed line.

.Consider the local in which the number is written.
[source,java]
----
/**
    * Use the default locale to parse a double value from a string.
    * @param input string
    * @return the double
    * @throws ParseException if the string does not parse to double.
    */
static double getDoubleConsideringLocale( String input )
   throws ParseException {
    return DecimalFormat.getNumberInstance().parse( input ).doubleValue(); // <1>
}

/**
* Use the given locale to parse a double value from a string.
* @param locale to use.
* @param input string.
* @return the double.
* @throws ParseException if the string does not parse to double.
*/
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
static double getDoubleConsideringLocale( Locale locale, String input )
    throws ParseException {
=======
static double getDoubleConsideringLocale( Locale locale, String input )
  throws ParseException {
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
    return DecimalFormat.getNumberInstance(locale).parse( input ).doubleValue();
}
----

<1> DecimalFormat.getNumberInstance gets a format that understands the default locale.

.Set the locale for the execution. Useful for tests.
[source,java]
----
Locale.setDefault( Locale.GERMANY ); // <1>
----

<1> Set the locale to GERMANY if it isn't already. Similar for other languages.


=== Testing Localized Exceptions

The standard way of testing exceptions with assertj is explained in link:week01.html#_assert_exceptions[week01].

To get to the localized message, which contains the message as translated by the locale framework is a bit more involved.

Luckily, AssertJ allows you to extract information from a Throwable, by using an extractor function. Now the Lambda bells should ring.

.To make a long story very short: here is an example:
[source,java]
----
String[] keys = keyWords.split( "\\|");
assertThatThrownBy( () -> {
            MainSimulation.main( args );
} ).isExactlyInstanceOf( exceptionMap.get( expectionClassName ) )
        .extracting( e -> e.getLocalizedMessage() ) // <1>
        .asString()           //<2>
        .contains( keys ); //<3>
----

<1> extract using [blue]`Function<? super Throwable,â€‹T>`, [black]`e -> getLocalizedMessage()` in this case.
<2> Get the assertion for in String. Do [red]*not* use `toString()`, because that produces a _String_, not an [blue]*AbstractStringAssert*.
<3> And use the assert to check that the string contains the required key information.

.If you turn on type hints in NetBeans-IDE (or in vscode/intelij) you can see what the type is on which you call `contains(keys)`
