=== Improved Map in Java 8


I personally find the java.util.Map quit interesting because it got a number of very cool features in
Java 7 and 8 that are really very helpful if you want to implement things like *caches*.
If you are into caching and expect many entries, consider a https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/WeakHashMap.html[WeakHashMap],
that also helps to solve the problem of keeping the cache small and auto-evacuate when entries are no longer used.


In order of appearance in the api doc:

* https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Map.html#compute(K,java.util.function.BiFunction)[compute] Attempts to compute a mapping for the specified key and its current mapped value (or null if there is no current mapping).
* https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Map.html#computeIfAbsent(K,java.util.function.Function)[computeIfAbsent] If the specified key is not already associated with a value (or is mapped to null), attempts to compute its value using the given mapping function and enters it into this map unless null.
* https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Map.html#computeIfPresent(K,java.util.function.BiFunction)[computeIfPresent] If the value for the specified key is present and non-null, attempts to compute a new mapping given the key and its current mapped value.
* https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Map.html#getOrDefault(java.lang.Object,V)[getOrDefault] Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or defaultValue if this map contains no mapping for the key.
* https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Map.html#putIfAbsent(K,V)[putIfAbsent] If the specified key is not already associated with a value (or is mapped to null) associates it with the given value and returns null, else returns the current value.
and of course

* https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Map.html#forEach(java.util.function.BiConsumer)[forEach] Performs the given action for each entry in this map until all entries have been processed or the action throws an exception.

.which allows you to quickly look at the contents of a map with a one-liner
[source,java]
----
    map.forEach((k, v) -> System.out.println(k + "=" + v));
----

The fun thing is that all these methods are default methods, so they apply to all classes that implement the java.util.Map interface, including the ones you roll yourselves,
might you feel the inclination. To implement a special map that has specific extra properties, you only need to extend https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/AbstractMap.html[AbstractMap]
which needs the implementation of one or two methods only, depending if you want an unmodifiable of modifiable one.
