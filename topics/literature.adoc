== Study materials



* For the Java basics and advanced features we are using Cay Horstmann's fine books from the core Java series.
  They are on the book-list from September.
* The exercises will be published via a personal github repository.
* The Junit version is https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/[Junit 5].
* "Using frameworks for testing" will start with using https://assertj.github.io/doc/[AssertJ],
  which is a modern and up to date Open Source testing framework. The documentation is of excellent quality and fun to read.
