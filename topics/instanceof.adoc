== `instanceof` operator

Regularly you need to check for a _type_ before your can do an operation on a given object.
Before you can use the object as a type, you need to cast it as that _type_ so the compiler will accept 
the operations you want to do with the type.

.Test object for string-ness, if so, take length.
[source,java]
----

    if ( obj instanceof String ) {
        String s= (String) obj;
        return s.length();
    }
----

Since java 16, with https://openjdk.org/jeps/394[JEP 394] this has been simplified to let the `instanceof` operator not only do the 
test, but also the cast, if the test is successful.

.Test object for string-ness, if so, take length.

    if ( obj instanceof String s ) { ;<1>
        return s.length();
    }

<1> Note the assignment to `s` and cast to `String` after the successful test.

The variable `s` is only in scope (known) _inside_ the if block, and only if the test passes.

As another illustration, an implementation of `equals` for a Person class.

[source,java]
----

class Person{
    String name;
    LocalDate dob;
    public boolean equals (Object o) {
        if (o instanceof Person p) {
            return this.name.equals(p.name) &&
                this.dob.equals(p.dob);
        }
    }
    return false;
}
