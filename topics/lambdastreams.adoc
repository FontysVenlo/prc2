== Streams, SQL like operations expressed in Java 8

Here too, the https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/stream/package-summary.html[package documentation] is an interesting read.

A stream can be considered a conveyor belt on which objects experience operations.
The belt starts at a source (for instance a Supplier) and can on or more _intermediate_ operations and end with a Terminal operation.

Here your see a physical stream and a collect operation.

=== SQL like functions

.assume you want to know the sum of the wages for women.
[source,sql]
select sum(salary)
from   people
where  gender = 'FEMALE'

.same in Java, get the sum of payments to women.
[source,java,numbered]
----
    int womensPay =
        people.stream()                                         // <1>
            .filter(p -> p.getGender() == Person.Gender.FEMALE) // <2>
            .mapToInt(p -> p.getSalary())                       // <3>
            .sum();                                             // <4>
----

<1> use people collection as source and start stream
<2> where ... where gender = female
<3> mapping is often retrieving the value of a member, get salary, note that it is a Map ToIntFunction<Person> specialised function
<4> aggregation, like `sum()` here is a terminal operation

.variant using a method reference.
[source,java,numbered]
----
    int womensPay =
        people.stream()
            .filter(p -> p.getGender() == Person.Gender.FEMALE)
            .mapToInt( Person::getSalary )                      // <1>
            .sum();
----

<1> This alternative uses a *method reference*, which can be substituted for a lambda expression when their shapes match.
