=== Maven Modules

Many projects will have more than just one component (jar or war file).
Think of the parallel project project 2.

It is a good idea to reflect this design in the way you structure your source code:
use multiple modules.

==== Module

A Maven module is just a maven project, that has a pom.xml which defines the relation with
other modules.


.Modules and parent.

As you see in the figure, the parent lists its children. The children may have
inter-dependencies. Otherwise it is just plain maven.

[source,xml]

    <<parent>
      <groupId>io.github.fontysvenlo</groupId>
      <artifactId>informaticspom</artifactId>
      <version>1.2</version>
      <relativePath/>
    </parent>
    groupId>nl.fontys.sebivenlo</groupId>
    <artifactId>parentpom</artifactId>
    <version>1.0</version>
    <packaging>pom</packaging>
    <properties>
      <version>1.0</version>
    </properties>
    <modules>
        <module>entities</module>
        <module>db</module>
        <module>app-logic</module>
        <module>ui</module>
        <module>restserver</module>
    </modules>

As is usual between parents and children, there is an inheritance relationship.
The children inherit setting and groupid, and version, if defined as a property. Note that thare is a a "grand"parent here too, the informaticspom, so
you can apply all the good things you learned in PRC2 to your project as well.


[WARNING]
====
Do not declare dependencies of the children in the parent pom, because that introduces a cycle
in the dependencies: parent depends on child, which depends on parent, which depend .... etc.
====


The parent pom can declare all external dependencies, that are shared between the children, such as the testing frameworks,
any other external dependencies. The parent can declare its own parent, allowing it to inherit and pass on anything that
inherits from such parent. 

// The parent defines the packaging as `pom`, the children what ever is required, typically jar, war, or ear.

// .example pom for rest server.
// [source,xml]

// <project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"

//         <artifactId>parentpom</artifactId>
//         <version>1.0</version>
//          <!-- parent directory .. as parent is natural but not mandatory -->
//         <relativePath>..</relativePath>
//     </parent>
//     <artifactId>restserver</artifactId>
//     <version>${version}</version>
//     <packaging>war</packaging>
//     <name>Rest server</name>
// </project>

Putting things in modules has the following advantages:

* It promotes loose coupling.
* It can avoid the chicken and egg problem: In a normal build, it wants all tests to pass, to be able
  to continue. For business code that is correct, but things like integration tests need a built war file, which cannot be built with failing tests. +
  Solution: Put the integration tests in a separate module of its own, which can be run at any time and will not slow you down or
  worse, disable testing or not having any tests.
