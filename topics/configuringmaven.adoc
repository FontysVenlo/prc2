== Configuring Maven

Maven and maven projects are first class citizens in the NetBeans world.

Since we build with maven, we are not really bound to particular IDE,
other than for editing and maybe the odd debug session.footnote:[Working test driven will typically not need those].
If you choose to a use an IDE that is not prescribed by teachers, expect no help from the teachers.

We have many things to share with you, and we use maven for that.

We share libraries and project configuration files (pom.xml) with our students.
