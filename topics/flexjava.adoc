== Flex Your Java Muscles

*Remark: this paragraph is not updated for newer java versions, but it shows the concept. The code / script snippets can't be used as-is.*

No, it is not about heavy lifting. It is about reconfiguring your Java
environment easily.
It also assumes that you are in the habit of using the command line over the GUI.

Sure, a GUI is 'user friendly' if you are willing to look for the things your want to use, and know where
you need to look for it. But what about the computer listening to you for a change, instead of you having to scroll through its wealth of
options and other stuff you may have installed.

This is a *POSIX* hack, meaning that it applies to Linux and to Mac OS-X (with a little tweaking) alike.
It may also apply to Windows when using git-bash, MINGW, Powershell or the 'Linux extensions for windows'. You mileage may vary though.

=== Concepts used

* `$PATH` The PATH environment variable that determines the way programs are found in the command line. +
  all commands that you can enter on the commandline are found using the `$PATH` variable.
* `$JAVA_HOME` The environment variable that tells where your java installation lives. It is used by apache-ant (ant) and apache-maven (mvn) alike.
* You set these variables in your start-up script, like `.bashrc` and `.zshrc`.
* You use aliases to abbreviate your commands.
* You start the IDE from the command line. Always, so YOU are in control of where and how it's started.

The whole operation involves three modifications:

. Set the variables in your `~/.bashrc`.
. Add a helper script, called J, put it in a directory in your PATH. ${HOME}/bin is a good place, if that is on your path.
. Create aliases, to make typing the command simple, like *j8* to switch to Java 8 and *j12* to do the same for Java 12.

=== Setting in startup script

.setting JAVA_HOME and PATH in ~/.bashrc
[source,sh]
----
## DEFAULT IS JAVA 8 HERE
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle
export PATH=${JAVA_HOME}/bin:$PATH
----

=== Switching to other Java version

.updating  JAVA_HOME and PATH to switch java version.
[source,sh]
----
include::J[]
----

===  All made simple with aliases

You can tie this all together with some https://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/aliases.html[aliases] which classically are stored
in a file called `${HOME}/.bash_aliases` and are loaded on login and each time you open a terminal.

.using aliases to switch with simple command. Excerpt from my .bash_aliases file.
[source,sh]
----
alias j12='eval $(J12)'
alias j11='eval $(J11)'
alias j8='eval $(J8)'
----

.see it all work

As you will notice, switching Java versions in this way is _very fast_.
