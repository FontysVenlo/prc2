== Getting Started

To work successfully with the programs needed for PRC2, you need to install them first.
Properly installing Java and other programs is not hard but must be done precisely.
What will follow is a description on how to do that under Ubuntu Linux, macOS and Windows.
You can adapt this configuration for other operating systems too, possibly with a few tweaks.

[TIP]
====
It is best to get fairly familiar with the command line pretty soon, because in the end it will make you much more effective.
Since 2018, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x73WTEltyHU[bash] is also available on Windows 10, and it is the default shell of Ubuntu-Linux and was the default shell on macOS until version 10.15. The default shell on macOS is now Zsh, we will specify the differences between bash and zsh where necessary.
====

[WARNING]
====
Before you install any software from the internet, please validate the the package. You typically see signature files such as SHA-256 or PGP-ASC, os something similar,
which can help to ascertain that the package is the one you think it is. For instance with:

icon:linux[fw] `$ sha512sum /path/to/file` +
icon:apple[fw] `$ shasum -a 256 /path/to/file` +
icon:windows[fw] `$ certUtil -hashfile /path/to/file SHA256`

You can check the download of that version of your IDE, and the command should produce the same signature as is available on the download website.
====


== Setting up the correct environment

=== Install Java

The default installation paths are:

icon:linux[fw] `/usr/lib/jvm` +
icon:apple[fw] `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/` +
icon:windows[fw] `C:\Program Files\AdoptOpenJDK\`

[WARNING]
====
Do [red]*NOT* use `Program Files` under Windows, because of the space in the name,
 but instead create a separate directory simply called
 e.g. `c:\usr\lib\jvm` if you insist on using Windows.
 On other OSs it is also important to make sure paths do NOT contains spaces,
 as spaces are also used as separators for arguments
====

Installation of Java can be done either through a package manager or by downloading the
the Java distribution from  https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=21[AdoptOpenJDK ^].
For PRC2 we will use [blue]*Java 21*.

==== icon:linux[fw] Linux

[NOTE]
====
We are using Debian based Linux, such as Fedora or Ubuntu, for the instructions on this page.
We assume that that if you are running a different distribution of Linux that you can adapt the
instructions to apply to that distribution (e.g. use the correct package manager Zypper, PacMan, etc.).
====

With a package manager:

.icon:linux[fw] install openjdk via apt-get on ubuntu
[source,sh]
----
sudo apt install openjdk-21-jdk
----

.icon:linux[fw] install eclipse temurin via apt-get
[source,sh]
----
apt-get install -y wget apt-transport-https gnupg
wget -O - https://packages.adoptium.net/artifactory/api/gpg/key/public | apt-key add -
echo "deb https://packages.adoptium.net/artifactory/deb $(awk -F= '/^VERSION_CODENAME/{print$2}' /etc/os-release) main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/adoptium.list
apt-get update # update if you haven't already
apt-get install temurin-21-jdk
----

Manual installation:

In the example below we assume that the distribution is packed as a `tar.gz` archive.
The example shows the archive name as of 21 Januari 2024,
`OpenJDK21U-jdk_x64_linux_hotspot_21.0.2_13.tar.gz`

.icon:linux[fw] unpack java distribution using the command-line
[source,sh]
----
sudo mkdir -p /usr/lib/jvm
cd /usr/lib/jvm
sudo tar xf ~/Downloads/OpenJDK21U-jdk_x64_linux_hotspot_21.0.2_13.tar.gz
----

==== icon:apple[fw] macOS

With HomeBrew:

.icon:apple[fw] install via HomeBrew
[source,sh]
----
# Untap AdoptOpenJDK first
brew untap AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk

# If you want to download latest version
brew install --cask temurin

# To install specific version
brew tap homebrew/cask-versions
brew install --cask temurin21
----

Manual installation:

Download the correct distribution/version of choice from
https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=21[AdoptOpenJDK ^].
Install the same way as normal programs.

==== icon:windows[fw] Windows

Install with the Windows Package Manager:

First install the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/#install-winget[winget]

.icon:windows[fw] install via powershell
[source,sh]
----
winget install Microsoft.OpenJDK.21
----

Manual installation:

Download the correct distribution/version of choice from
https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=21[AdoptOpenJDK ^].
Install the same way as normal programs,

[WARNING]
====
Do [red]*NOT* forget to change the install path during installation. +
e.g. `C:\usr\lib\jvm\` +
Also make sure to check Add to path and Add JAVA HOME.
====

=== Make Java available on the PATH

If you used a package manager or an installer to install Java, then Java should already be added to your path.
However if you manually extracted the binaries then you should still add Java to the path.

The `$PATH` environment variable is used by the command line processor to find the commands or programs whose name you type as first word in a command line.
If you type `java -version`, and your shell says `command not found`, then your path does not include the java program yet.

Since we want the best Java experience, we will use some common environment variables.

==== icon:linux[fw] Linux

*JAVA_HOME* Define JAVA_HOME first. That will help Java, but also tell other programs to find the desired Java version.

.icon:linux[fw] Define JAVA_HOME
[source,sh]
----
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64 #<1>
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/temurin-17-jdk #<2>
----
<1> Path for manual installation
<2> Path for package manager installation

*PATH* Prepend the directory under JAVA_HOME to your path, so all java related programs, such as `java` , `javac`, `jar` etc can be found, by just typing the name.

.icon:linux[fw] Append Java to the path
[source,sh]
----
export PATH=${JAVA_HOME}/bin:$PATH
----

To avoid having to do this every time you start the command-line, add the commands to your `~/.bashrc`/`~/.zshrc` script  file, at the bottom.

.icon:linux[fw] Add JAVA_HOME to PATH
[source,sh]
----
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64
export PATH=${JAVA_HOME}/bin:$PATH
----

To switch Java versions use the following command:

.icon:linux[fw] Switch Java versions
[source,sh]
----
sudo update-alternatives --config java
----

==== icon:apple[fw] macOS

These instructions will guide you to setup the correct environment on macOS
and to make it easy to switch between Java versions.

.icon:apple[fw] List version(s) of Java
[source,sh]
----
/usr/libexec/java_home
/usr/libexec/java_home -V
----
The first command lists the most recent version of Java on your system
The second command lists all installed versions of Java on your system

We can now setup an environment to easily switch between Java versions and later on even launch most IDEs with the intended Java version.
The only thing we need to do for this is set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to link to the correct Java version.

.icon:apple[fw] Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment
[source,sh]
----
export JAVA_HOME=<path_to_java_home>
----

Where the <path_to_java_home> can be obtained by the command above with the -V parameter.


.icon:apple[fw] Check that `JAVA_HOME` is set correctly
[source,sh]
----
echo $JAVA_HOME
----

However instead of hardcoding the path it is better to retrieve the path while setting the environment.

.icon:apple[fw] Set `JAVA_HOME` dynamically with the following command (e.g. for Java 15):
[source,sh]
----
export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)
----
$() means that the invocation between parenthesis is resolved first.

This sets the correct Java environment for your current Terminal session.
When opening a new terminal the default Java environment will be active again.
To make switching between Java versions in the terminal easier we can set-up what is called an alias.
An alias is basically a shortcut, you specify the keyboard shortcut and which commands should be executed.
We want these aliases to always be available,
for this we need to let the terminal know to load our aliases on startup.
Depending on the type of terminal you are using, we need the specify the aliases at different places.

Since macOS Catalina (10.15) the default shell (which is used by the terminal) is ZShell (zsh).
This means we can specify our aliases in either `.zshrc` or in `.zprofile` in our home directory. We suggest to
create an additional configuration file `.java_setup` in your home directory.

[#java_setup]
.icon:apple[fw] Add the following lines to ~/.zshrc:
[source,sh]
----
# Include java environment setup
source .java_setup
----

.icon:apple[fw] Add the following lines to ~/.java_setup:
[source,sh]
----
# Set your default JAVA_HOME
export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 17.0.6)

alias j11="export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 11.0.12`; java -version"
alias j17="export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 17.0.6`; java -version"
alias j21="export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 21.0.2`; java -version"

# Add maven to path
export PATH=/Applications/maven/apache-maven-3.9.0/bin:$PATH
----

We now need to either restart the terminal for the aliases to take effect or source the `.zshrc` file:

`source ~/.zshrc`

We can now check that switching between versions works:

.icon:apple[fw] switching between Java versions
[source,sh]
----
java -version
j11
j17
j21
----
Check that the default Java version is correct
Check that switching between versions works
Check that switching between versions works
Check that switching between versions works

Now we have set-up a way to easily switch between Java versions in the terminal.

==== icon:windows[fw] Windows

Java should already be added to the path by the installer,
as it is a default setting during installation.

=== Install Apache Maven

We will use *Apache Maven*, or *maven* for short throughout the PRC2 course, so you will need that too.

The application is called *Maven* but as command spelled as `mvn`.

Maven is the default build tool in the Java world and can build your program from sources without the use of and IDE. This makes your project agnostic to the IDE used. Most IDEs will detect your project as a maven project if the `pom.xml` file is present in the root of your project.
Maven is also the way the teachers use to compile and test the students work for the practical assignments and performance assessments.

==== icon:linux[fw] Linux

Install with package manager:

.icon:linux[fw] Install maven using apt-get
[source,sh]
----
sudo apt install maven
----

Install manually:
[#maven_manual]

Fetch a fresh copy of https://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven] from the website.

To install it, do (example uses version 3.9.6  as of 2024-01-21)

.icon:linux[fw] install apache maven and add to path
[source,sh]
----
cd /usr/share
sudo rm -fr maven
sudo tar xf ~/Downloads/apache-maven-3.9.6-bin.tar.gz
sudo ln -sf apache-maven-3.9.6/ maven
cd /usr/bin
sudo ln -sf ../share/maven/bin/mvn .
----

Once this is done, entering  `mvn --version` should produce output.

==== icon:apple[fw] macOS

Install with HomeBrew:

.icon:apple[fw] Install Maven using HomeBrew
[source,sh]
----
brew install maven
----

Install manually:

Fetch a fresh copy of https://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven] from the website. Unzip the archive at
an appropriate location (e.g. /Applications). Make sure to put maven on the path, see <<java_setup, java_setup>>.

Once this is done, entering  `mvn --version` should produce output.


==== icon:windows[fw] Windows

Install with Chocolately:

`choco install maven`

Install manually:

. Download the zip file from https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi.
. Extract the zip file to `C:\usr\lib`
. Add the `bin` directory to the `path`
.. Goto `Settings > About > Advanced System Settings > Adavanced Tab > Environment Variables`
.. Select `Path` and `Edit`
.. `New` and fill in the path `C:\usr\lib\apache-maven-3.6.3\bin`
. Close `System Properties`
. Start `cmd`
. `mvn -v` should return a version


=== Install or update your IDE

You are free to choose your own Integrated Development Environment (IDE). An IDE allows you to write, compile, run and debug your programs in one place.
Popular choices are:

- https://code.visualstudio.com/[Visual Studio Code]
- https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ IDEA]
- https://netbeans.apache.org/[NetBeans]
