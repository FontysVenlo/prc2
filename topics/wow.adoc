== Way of Working during practical hours.

The way of working with the practical assignments is as follows:

* Each student has a personal github repository
* The teachers will provide starter templates in due time via Github classroom.
* The students will work on the assignment and work TDD style.
** Write a test for a requirement (typically a method), +
  see it showing failure ([red,bold]*RED*),
** then implement the method to turn the test [green,bold]*GREEN*.
** If [green,bold]*GREEN*, svn-commit both test-class AND implementing class.
* If the assignment is complete (all requirements covered with tests, all tests green and code coverage at an appropriate level )
  push the code to your repository.
** Pushing to the repository will also start the test on CodeGrade.
