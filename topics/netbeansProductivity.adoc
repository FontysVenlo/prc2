== Adding your own code templates to NetBeans IDE

Productivity can be helped big time, if you add code templates
to NetBeans. Quite a few are predefined but you can add your own too.

Go to Tools > Options > Editor > Code Templates. (for Mac, use NetBeans > Preferences instead of Tools > Options)

You get this dialog:

You can add one with the new button, Duh.

I find this one quite convenient:

.Definition of my codetemplate *jutm*
[source,java]
----
//@Disabled("think TDD")
@${baseType type="org.junit.jupiter.api.Test" default="Test" editable="false"}
public void ${method}(){
    fail("method ${method} reached end. You know what to do.");
}
----

* As of January 2020 `jutm` is junit 5 specific.
* Note that `@Disabled` is a tag that is only used when writing all test bodies beforehand.
* Once you start writing the test, you should remove or comment (best) the `@Disabled` to make the test effective.
