== The state of things
== Implementing behavior using state machines.


Systems sometimes have to exhibit some kind of behavior that is different observable
 output over time. This is different from a pure function, which will always produce the
same output for the same input. The behavior differs depending on the 'history'
the system experienced, typically in the form of 'events' or method calls that happened over time.
Such method calls change the state the system is in. We call such behavior state-full
and this way of operating is often implemented using a 'state machine'.
In this week and in the AADE course we will be using two concepts:

. The state (machine) diagram
. The State pattern

'''

image:lamp-battery-switch.gif[role="left thumb", title="simple switch circuit, from 'https://electronics.stackexchange.com/'"] A state machine
 is a software concept used to implement the behavior of something whose 'reaction'
 or outcome depends on the events that happened over time. A very simple example is a lamp and a switch.
When properly connected and none of the parts is defect, the bulb will light up when the switch is in the on state.
As state machine: the switch passes current when it has been turned on, which can be expressed as a turn-on event, making the bulb light up.
From the diagram it should be obvious that a current can only flow if the switch is in the on (or closed) state.

In software we model this as the _path_ the code takes, which then depends on some condition or value.

The state diagram is a way to express the behavior in a graphical manner. Each state of the system is drawn as a box with rounded corners, like in the diagram above.
In the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern[GoF State ^] pattern, which is an object oriented way of modeling state behavior, one uses different
objects to realize the effect of changing the software path. The objects all implement the same interface, but have a different implementation.
Then, whenever a state switching event occurs, the current state object is replaced by the state object for the new state.

From AADE course, we learned that a life cycle of a system changes throw using by so called transitions. To change the state from wait to lock, trigger event  was needed with a guard (condition) and then we did some activity.

image:railway-switch.gif[role="right thumb", title="railway switch from 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railroad_switch'"] As another analogy, you can think of a railway switch.
The active state object will always have the same behavior. One makes the train go _straight_, the other makes it go _right_.
Each state on itself always does the same, like a pure function, so with the same input (train) the same output is produced.
The switching between states makes it possible to control the direction of the train traffic.

State machines or state charts can be implemented in several ways. In this week we will apply an OO approach using the well known
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern[State Pattern ^], combined with [blue]`enums` and some Java 8 features, in particular [blue]`default` methods.

The *State* Pattern has the following UML class diagram:

image::StatePattern.svg[role="left thumb",title="State Pattern"]
We deal with a context, an _abstract_ state and multiple concrete state implementations that do the work
and represent the state elements in the diagram. In the diagram above there
would be a state instance for both *ConcreteStateA* and *ConcreteStateB*.
In the implementation of the exercise of this week we will be using [blue]`enum` as the basic construct for our work.


Using a functional state approach by using `enum` has the following advantages:

* There is no chance of creating new states. Enum ensures that the only
  instances there ever will be are created at class loading time. You always know all states there ever will be.
* A state can be implemented as a pure function, making the number of tests needed minimal. The inputs to the state are
  the state of the context (or technically, the state stored in the context), the inputs, and the event or method call.
* Such functions and thereby state instances can be shared between contexts, because functional states do not have any
  state themselves. The actual state is saved in the context. This is not because [blue]##enum##s
  cannot have state, they can, but because a functional state in a state-machine shouldn't.
  It [big]#IS# the state and should [big]#not have# any. It should always do the same. More importantly, they are immutable,
  meaning no one can break them by setting some wrong value.
* A functional state is easily tested without a need for a complex context.
  The context can easily be _mocked_ as can be seen in this week's olifantysballs exercise.

The disadvantage of using functional states in this way is that they cannot keep information themselves, such as counting something.
But quite often the counting involves only a few possible values, which can be states themselves, or can be realized in the context.
As an example for few counting states you might consider a traffic light which counts green, yellow, red.


[WARNING,role="red"]
====
A common error made by novice programmers is to call a method inside a constructor that takes the constructor's type as a parameter.

.Do [big red]*not* do this inside the constructor
[source,java]
----
    StateMachine(){
      this.initialState = State.IDLE;
      this.initialState.enter( this ); // <1>

    }
----

<1> Problematic call of someField.enter(this) inside constructor. Something to avoid.

The problem is that the constructor may not yet be complete, in particular when fields are defined and
initialized later in the constructor or even after the constructor definition.

To avoid this problem, you typically have some init() method that should be called after construction or use a factory method that does something similar.
In the gumball machine we chose the later. You can find the details in the javadoc documentation of the exercise.

.Use init method.
[source,java]
----
StateMachine(){
  this.initialState = State.IDLE;

}

StateMachine init(){
  this.initialState.enter( this ); // <1>
  return this;
}
----

.Caller has not much extra work.
[source,java]
----
    StateMachine sm = new StateMachine().init();

[TIP]
Do not always use all tricks you've learned so far. They are not always needed.
In particular, states do not have to be generic, and with
enums that would even be impossible, because an enum value is a leaf class all by it self,
so making it generic for later specialisation like in the link:../generics/#_self_use_in_generic_definitions[Zoo example in part 4] is futile.
If you appear to run into this situation, because your [green]*context* is generic, do not simply use raw objects but see if you can refactor out an interface that is NOT generic,
to be implemented by the context that wants to be generic. You will see that in the JsonMarshaller, the state machine part.

== State machines and regular expressions

You can find a lot on the relation between state machines and regular expressions.
In most cases, including in Java, the regex is translated or compiled into a statemachine (just) before matches are attempted.

A nice illustration is given by the
https://regexper.com/[REGEXPER] website, that turns a regex into a railroad diagram. This make the understanding of a regular expression way easier.

//http://ivanzuzak.info/noam/webapps/fsm_simulator/[Finite State Machine Simulator] by Ivan Zuzak.


A simple regex : Dutch postal code: `"\d{4}\s[A-Z]{2}"`

.with diagram
image::postcode-regex.svg[]

The postcode railroad diagram reads as a digit followed by 3 more digits, a space, a letter and one more letter.


.More complex example:
[source,java]
----
// note that you can break off the regex in java and intersperse it with comments.
String emailRegex="^[a-zA-Z0-9.!#$%&''*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+"+ // quite some rubish before the at sign
     "@"+ // the at sign followed by a more restricted set of chars,
          //  with some lengths restrictions
     "[a-zA-Z0-9](?:[a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9])?"+ // optional non capt grp
     // any number of letter-number combos
     "(?:\\.[a-zA-Z0-9](?:[a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9])?)*$";
----

.Produces this 'railroad' diagram. which is equivalent to a state machine diagram.

Note that there is not one TRUE regex for email addresses. If you want to know the nitty-gritty details
of valid email addresses look at RFC 8398 or RFC 5322, or ask in CSAR class.

[WARNING]
====
Once you understand that regexes are state machine specifications, and that it is easy to create state machines
that never 'terminate', you understand that regular expressions can also be dangerous.

Accepting a regular expression
from any source may cause a denial of service attack, because such expression may put your server into an endless loop.

Advice: only accept a restricted set of regexes, maybe parse them before use. In particular avoid back tracking constructs.
