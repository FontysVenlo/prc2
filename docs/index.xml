You clicked on the nice TMC button in NetBeans and then you could see which parts of your code worked, and which didn’t.</description></item><item><title>Parameterized tests</title><link>https://fontysvenlo.github.io/prc2/docs/parameterized-tests/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Feb 2022 14:17:33 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fontysvenlo.github.io/prc2/docs/parameterized-tests/</guid><description>Table of ContentsParameterized testsParameterized test, Junit 5 styleLookup in a map.Test data from a fileRepeated use of same data.Test Recipe I, Test Equals and hashCodeLinksParameterized testsYou will often see that test methods look a lot like each other. As an example: In the fraction exercise, in most test methods you have two inputs and one or two results, then an operation is done followed by some assertion, often of the same kind.</description></item><item><title>Database Access using JDBC</title><link>https://fontysvenlo.github.io/prc2/docs/database-access/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Mar 2022 13:53:06 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fontysvenlo.github.io/prc2/docs/database-access/</guid><description>Table of ContentsJava DataBase ConnectivityDataBase connection credentials and Java PropertiesUsing a Data sourceResultSetAnatomy of a prepared statementTraditional preparing statementsDatabase Meta InformationCheck constraintsTransactionsUsing Stored ProceduresDAO’sJava DataBase ConnectivityDataBase connection credentials and Java PropertiesSome things do NOT belong in source code.

For the Java developers at Oracle and others involved in the OpenJDK project it was considered a necessary step to make Java fit for the future and make it possible to shed some old nasty problems.</description></item><item><title>Generics</title><link>https://fontysvenlo.github.io/prc2/docs/generics/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Mar 2022 13:53:06 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fontysvenlo.github.io/prc2/docs/generics/</guid><description>Table of ContentsGenericsGenerics, the fine printCheating the compilerWildcard and boundsLower bound or Contra variantSelf use in Generic definitionsTesting genericsGenericsGenerics is mainly a compiler feature. In java (at least the versions up to this moment, March 2022) it is even more so, because after the compiler had it’s go with it, it largely discards the generic information, and the runtime, the JVM, does not really care about generics and does not use it.</description></item><item><title>Desgin for testability</title><link>https://fontysvenlo.github.io/prc2/docs/design-for-testability/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Feb 2022 11:28:06 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fontysvenlo.github.io/prc2/docs/design-for-testability/</guid><description>Table of ContentsFaking as a testing techniqueStay cool, have a Mockito.To Mock or To ConfigureDesign for Test-abilityBusiness class fit for testingFaking as a testing technique&amp;#34;When you can’t or won’t make it, Fake it&amp;#34;
