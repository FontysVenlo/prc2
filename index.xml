You clicked on the nice TMC button in NetBeans and then you could see which parts of your code worked, and which didn’t.</description></item><item><title>Setup</title><link>https://fontysvenlo.github.io/prc2/pages/setup/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Feb 2022 14:30:36 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fontysvenlo.github.io/prc2/pages/setup/</guid><description>Table of ContentsGetting StartedSetting up the correct environmentInstall JavaMake Java available on the PATHInstall Apache MavenInstall or update your IDESubversionConfiguring MavenSebipom 3.0.3Sebipom and Java FXUsing the SeBiPom in your own projectsUpgrade all projects with one commandAdditional PointersGetting StartedTo work successfully with the programs needed for PRC2, you need to install them first. Properly installing Java and other programs is not hard but must be done precisely. What will follow is a description on how to do that under Ubuntu Linux, macOS and Windows.</description></item><item><title>Parameterized tests</title><link>https://fontysvenlo.github.io/prc2/docs/parameterized-tests/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Feb 2022 14:17:33 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fontysvenlo.github.io/prc2/docs/parameterized-tests/</guid><description>Table of ContentsParameterized testsParameterized test, Junit 5 styleLookup in a map.Test data from a fileRepeated use of same data.Test Recipe I, Test Equals and hashCodeLinksParameterized testsYou will often see that test methods look a lot like each other. As an example: In the fraction exercise, in most test methods you have two inputs and one or two results, then an operation is done followed by some assertion, often of the same kind.</description></item><item><title>JPMS, Lambda and Streams</title><link>https://fontysvenlo.github.io/prc2/docs/jpms-lambda-streams/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Mar 2022 13:53:06 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fontysvenlo.github.io/prc2/docs/jpms-lambda-streams/</guid><description>Table of ContentsJava Platform Module SystemChanges in visibilityJava Modules and TestingBlack box vs White BoxStandard Source code organization.Functional Interface Rationale&amp;lt;S.H.A.P.E.&amp;gt; of java.util.functionsWhere is toString?Method ReferencesStreams, SQL like operations expressed in Java 8SQL like functionsJava Platform Module SystemThe Java Platform Module System has been introduced with Java 9 and had a long development history at the point of introduction. For the Java developers at Oracle and others involved in the OpenJDK project it was considered a necessary step to make Java fit for the future and make it possible to shed some old nasty problems.</description></item><item><title>Generics</title><link>https://fontysvenlo.github.io/prc2/docs/generics/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Mar 2022 13:53:06 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fontysvenlo.github.io/prc2/docs/generics/</guid><description>Table of ContentsGenericsGenerics, the fine printCheating the compilerWildcard and boundsLower bound or Contra variantSelf use in Generic definitionsTesting genericsGenericsGenerics is mainly a compiler feature. In java (at least the versions up to this moment, March 2022) it is even more so, because after the compiler had it’s go with it, it largely discards the generic information, and the runtime, the JVM, does not really care about generics and does not use it.</description></item><item><title>Desgin for testability</title><link>https://fontysvenlo.github.io/prc2/docs/design-for-testability/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Feb 2022 11:28:06 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fontysvenlo.github.io/prc2/docs/design-for-testability/</guid><description>Table of ContentsFaking as a testing techniqueStay cool, have a Mockito.To Mock or To ConfigureDesign for Test-abilityBusiness class fit for testingFaking as a testing technique&amp;#34;When you can’t or won’t make it, Fake it&amp;#34;
Let’s revisit the movie making metaphor. We know that almost everything in that industry is fake, or maybe more politely make-belief.
