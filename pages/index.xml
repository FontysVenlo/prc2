One such cultural aspect is the way you format your code, like placing your brackets, parenthesis, spaces and curly braces. This coding style is intended to help you read the code, recognize the structure at a glance and find the interesting details easily and spot on.
The official Java style is derived from the Kernighan and Ritchie (K&amp;amp;R) style for the C programming language.</description></item><item><title>Setup</title><link>https://fontysvenlo.github.io/prc2_web/pages/setup/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Feb 2022 14:30:36 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fontysvenlo.github.io/prc2_web/pages/setup/</guid><description>Getting Started To work successfully with the programs needed for PRC2, you need to install them first. Properly installing Java and other programs is not hard but must be done precisely. What will follow is a description on how to do that under Ubuntu Linux, macOS and Windows.

It is best to get fairly familiar with the command line pretty soon, because in the end it will make you much more effective.</description></item></channel></rss>
