== Write your own tests!

[big]#Throughout the exercises of PRC1, you have become acquainted with the value of tests: You have a way of checking if your code is any good without having to
test each and every part manually. You clicked on the nice TMC button in NetBeans and then you could see which parts of your code worked, and which didn't.
There is a catch though: Out there in the real world, there won't be any NetBeans button doing that magic for you, nor will some teacher or school
provide the tests for you, so [red]*you will be on your own*.#

But fret not! Writing tests is typically much simpler than writing the actual code. At least, it is when you follow a basic set of steps:

. [blue]**A**rrange: Prepare or set up the thing you want to test
. [blue]**A**ct: Interact with the object you are testing
. [blue]**A**ssert or Ensure that the observable result(s) is/are as expected.
. If it says [red]*boom*, then at least you learned something ....

// :sectums!:
// == Reading
// :sectnums:
//
// We assume that PRC1 covers the content of chapters 1 through 6 of Horstmann sufficiently. It does
// not hurt to skim through those first. We will introduce no new _java_ topics this week, but use
// in but use whatever was there up until week 11 o
//
//
// * Horstmann Core Java, Ed 11, Vol 1 Fundamentals Chapter 5 sections 5.1-5.5
// //* Horstmann Core Java, Ed 11, Vol 2 Advanced Feature
//

*Topics week 1*

* Test Driven Development.
* Maven configuration as exercise.
* **A**rrange **A**ct **A**ssert
* JUnit (5) as test framework.
* AssertJ as assertion library.

// On the theory of inheritance and interfaces. we will refine later on.
