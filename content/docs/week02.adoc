[TIP]
====
Think test driven! So write tests FIRST, and then code. Testing is ensuring that the code is usable.
To make code testable is also a design exercise: you need to make decisions about the design of your program when you write your tests. If you have no idea how to test it,
you are equally clueless about how to use the designed classes.
